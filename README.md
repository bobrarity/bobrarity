<p>Data Scientist | Machine Learning Engineer

I donâ€™t just build models â€” I work to understand the data, the context, and the problem. For me, good machine learning starts with knowing what the data represents and why it matters. Thatâ€™s what makes solutions useful.

What I do:
Some days Iâ€™m tuning models. Other days Iâ€™m digging into a new domain to understand its data. Iâ€™ve also mentored interns, run interviews, and helped build teams. I enjoy that just as much as the technical work.

What Iâ€™m focusing on:
Iâ€™m getting deeper into ML research to sharpen my skills and stay current. Iâ€™m also looking to take on more leadership â€” guiding teams and helping others grow in this space.
