<strong>Data Scientist | Machine Learning Engineer</strong>  
I donâ€™t just build models â€” I work to understand the data, the context, and the problem.  
For me, good machine learning starts with knowing what the data represents and why it matters. Thatâ€™s what makes solutions useful.

<br>

**What I do:**  
Some days Iâ€™m tuning models. Other days Iâ€™m digging into a new domain to understand its data.  
Iâ€™ve also mentored interns, run interviews, and helped build teams.

<br>

**What Iâ€™m focusing on:**  
Iâ€™m getting deeper into ML research to sharpen my skills and stay current.  
Also looking to take on more leadership â€” guiding teams and helping others grow.
